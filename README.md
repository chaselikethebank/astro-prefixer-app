## About

When you prefix a CSS framework (to avoid naming collisions with other frameworks in your codebase), you can no longer simply copy and paste UI components from the framework's documentation. This app solves that problem.

**How it works:**  
Set your prefix. Paste your code. Submit. Copy your prefixed code.

*Note: This tool works with any CSS framework by prefixing all class names in your HTML.*
